# Optional Local Icons

This repo does not ship legacy/personal icon files.

If you use filename-based icons (instead of embedded `iconData`), place your icon files in `icons/` on your own deployment.

For the maintainer's live deployment, `icons/` is symlinked to a server-private shared folder during deploy.
